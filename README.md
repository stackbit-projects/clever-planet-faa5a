URL: [stockscreener.dmdev.io](stockscreener.dmdev.io)

Built a stock screener web app with the companies that comprise S&P 500 market index. It was a personal full stack project made in 2 weeks using stock data provided by IEX stock API. The screener can be used to search, sort and filter companies by various technical and fundamental criteria (industry, market cap, share price, P/E ratio etc.).

* Built with React and Bootstrap on the frontend and Node, Express & PostgreSQL on the backend
* Created Express server with REST API endpoints connected to 3rd party APIs and postgres db 
* Implemented autosuggest search feature and user authentication using Auth0 
* Used Chart.js for stock price charts and other data visualizations
